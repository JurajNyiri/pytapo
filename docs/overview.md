# PyTapo: An Overview

## Introduction

PyTapo is a library for controlling Tapo cameras using Python. This library provides methods for interacting with a wide range of the camera's features, from basic operations such as getting and setting the camera's status to more advanced functions like accessing camera's SD card recordings. This document provides an overview of the library and how you can interact with Tapo cameras using PyTapo.

## Basic Setup

To use PyTapo, first, install it using pip:

```bash
pip install pytapo
```

Then import the `Tapo` class from the `pytapo` package in your Python script:

```python
from pytapo import Tapo
```

You can initialize a `Tapo` object with the IP address of your Tapo camera and the credentials to access it:

```python
camera = Tapo('192.168.0.10', 'admin', 'password')
```

## Features

Here are some of the features that PyTapo provides.

### Getting and Setting Camera Status

You can get the current status of the camera:

```python
status = camera.getStatus()
```

You can also change the status of the camera, for example, to enable or disable the privacy mode:

```python
camera.setPrivacyMode(True)  # Enable privacy mode
camera.setPrivacyMode(False) # Disable privacy mode
```

### Accessing the SD Card

PyTapo allows you to access the SD card on your Tapo camera. You can get a list of all the files on the SD card:

```python
files = camera.getSDCardRecordFiles()
```

You can also download a specific file from the SD card:

```python
camera.downloadSDCardRecordFile('recordfile.mp4', '/path/to/download/location/')
```

### Capturing and Saving Images

PyTapo allows you to capture a live image from the camera:

```python
image_data = camera.getLiveImage()
```

You can then save this image to a file:

```python
with open('image.jpg', 'wb') as file:
    file.write(image_data)
```

## Handling Errors

PyTapo raises a `TapoException` when it encounters an error. You can catch this exception and handle it as needed:

```python
from pytapo import Tapo, TapoException

try:
    camera = Tapo('192.168.0.10', 'admin', 'wrongpassword')
except TapoException as e:
    print(f'Error: {e.message}')
```

## Conclusion

PyTapo provides a simple and straightforward way to control Tapo cameras programmatically using Python. From basic operations like getting and setting the camera's status, to more advanced features like accessing the camera's SD card recordings, PyTapo provides the functions you need to integrate Tapo cameras into your Python projects.

Please note that this is a basic overview of PyTapo, and the actual library includes more advanced features and operations. For more detailed documentation, refer to the official PyTapo documentation.
